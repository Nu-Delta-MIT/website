    <span style="font-size: 48px">H</span>ere at Nu Delta Iâ€™ve found a sense of brotherhood. During these uncertain times we truly appreciate the strength and support our communities give us. I am grateful that this community cares about me. I want to give back to this Nu Delta community that has given so much to me. Moving forward we will continue to foster our community, making it even stronger, and ensuring that as times change and members come and go, students here in the Boston area will always be able to find a strong community here at Nu Delta.
