    <span style="font-size:48px">N</span>u Delta is a very close-knit community here at MIT that serves as an opportunity to escape many of the trials that accompany being a student. In my time in this fraternity, Iâ€™ve grown to know so many people who are a huge source of motivation for me, and who I can trust with any troubles I may have. The brothers of Nu Delta are very social, and enjoy forging new relationships as well as maintaining old ones. As president, my aim is to ensure we continue in our role as a welcoming space for members of the MIT community and beyond, and represent Nu Delta and MIT with pride and integrity in everything we do.
