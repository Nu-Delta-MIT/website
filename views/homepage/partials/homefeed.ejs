    <span style="font-size: 48px">C</span>oming to MIT, I was frightened that I wouldnâ€™t fit in. I was all the way across the country in a big city essentially alone. I immediately felt comfortable and at home when I came to Nu Delta. I found a place where I could put away the stress of MIT for a while and be surrounded by people that I could depend on for support when I need it most. Nu Delta has taught me many valuable lessons about personal responsibility, time management, and organization that I can take with me as I enter a full time career in a year and a half. I find in Nu Delta a vast network of mentors, a home away from home, and a warm community of not only my Brothers, but students from many schools in the Boston area.
