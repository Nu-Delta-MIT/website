    u Delta is a close, nurturing community that has become my second family over the past three years. MIT is a difficult place, so has been so important to build these strong relationships with my brothersâ€‹. They have shown me that life is more than problem sets and exams, and I am glad that I not only became a part of this community, but also its president. I am excited to lead this group of brothers who inspire each other to be the best versions of themselves every day. My goal as president is to continue building bonds not just between brothers, but also with the greater MIT community. I want this to continue to be a welcoming place for our community, and I am excited for us to continue representing Nu Delta and MIT with pride and integrity.
